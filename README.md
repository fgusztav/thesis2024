# SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE FOR OBJECT DETECTION: EVALUATING PERFORMANCE, SCALABILITY AND DEPLOYMENT AGAINST LOCAL SOLUTIONS

This repo contains:
- all code used for inference in my BSc thesis, with the user keys and credentials removed or censored
- all raw results from the runs used in the final analyses in my thesis

The code is in Python Jupyter format while the run results are found in the appropriately named zip file.
